# [4.1.0 release notes](https://github.com/TheTaylorLee/docker-transcodeautomation/releases/tag/4.1.0)
- v4.0.0 introduced breaking changes for existing installs, but doesn't impact new installs. Read carefully prior to migrating.
- It is highly recommended to make a backup of your media before migrating.

## Latest Tag Deprecated
- The latest tag has been deprecated in favor of the requirement to specify the specific version in the docker compose or docker run command. This will be maintained for all future releases and helps enforce breaking changes are not pushed without the release notes being first read.

## Breaking Changes (Required For Existing Installs Only)
- It is required that the container is first run once with the `UPDATEMETADATA=true` environment variable applied. After it completes processing files, the variable should be removed and the container restarted. This is necessary for the database and file indexes to be updated with new immutable index numbers. 
- _**Failure to follow that step will result in a loss of statistics and files being transcoded a second time.**_
- Files will be remuxed to update to the new indexing comment.
- Scripts for manually checking remuxed files against backups for failed files remuxes can be [found here](https://github.com/TheTaylorLee/docker-transcodeautomation/tree/main/examples/scripts). ffmpeg.exe must exist in terminal path.
