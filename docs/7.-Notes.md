- If a file is is replaced by another file of the same name, and the old file is deleted, statistics cannot update sooner than (25 hours + PROCDELAY + MINAGE). This ensures statistics are not lost in rare circumstances. Becuase of this the container must run at a minimum that long without restart prior to a replaced files database entry being updated.
- Docker logs should provide hints to the root of an issue and relevant snippets need to be included in opened issues.
- If the logs indicate that there are files leftover in the transcoding directory you must remove them. This is a safety feature that allows for addressing reasons for failed transcodes before continuing.
- If your media database becomes corrupted, use the backed-up databases to restore a healthy copy.
  - /docker-transcodeautomation/data/MediaDB.SQLite #database location
  - /docker-transcodeautomation/data/Backups #BackupsLocation
- If wanting to add media to an existing watched directory but not actually transcode it; remux it with the comment of dta-remuxed.

  ```bash
  # replace $oldname and $name with filepaths
  ffmpeg -hide_banner -loglevel error -stats -i $oldname -map 0:v:0? -map 0:a? -map 0:s? -metadata title="" -metadata description="" -metadata COMMENT="dta-remuxed" -c copy -stats_period 60 $name
  ```
