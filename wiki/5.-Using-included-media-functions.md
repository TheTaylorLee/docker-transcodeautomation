- This image comes with various optional PowerShell functions i've added for retrieving useful info. They are not necessary to use.
- `docker exec -i Docker-TranscodeAutomation /usr/bin/pwsh` to get an interactive shell
```powershell
#Media Management Functions
Get-EmptyFolder        #Gets empty directories that can be cleaned up.
Get-MissingYear        #Gets media missing the year of release in the name
Get-NotProcessed       #Get files not yet transcoded
Move-FileToMediaFolder #Move transcoded files back to media folders. TranscodeAutomation will handle this, but this can be useful to handle failed moves sooner.
```
